# SQL_ShutTheBox
SQL query for determining the least/most likely rolls when playing "Shut the Box" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shut_the_box)


Our version of StB has 2d6 and the possibilities are 1 - 10. 

This query allows you to specify the min/max possibilities (Some StB games are 1-9) and the number of sides on the dice.
It will show you the chance of rolling one of the numbers to "knock down" that number.


As my daughter grew, we changed the rules a bit to add in subtraction and multiplcation. Those possibilites are commented out, but can be uncommented to calculate percentages. You can also change the rules to have a larger span of numbers of knock down and different sided dice.
